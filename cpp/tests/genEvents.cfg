# rate is the events per second - choose a multiple of interval

#       genRandMSN generates a random MSN
#     N starts at 0

#     script - script to call
#     scriptType - EXEC_SH, EXEC_PERL or EXEC_BIN
#     paramN = param - n starts at 0, can also be a %%function%%
# transport is unixdomain or tcp
#   tcp parameters:
#     ip and service (required)
#     persistentpool = num connections
#   for unixdomain specify socketpath
# lifeTime in seconds
# readyTime in seconds, can also be a %%function%%
# reference is an integer value, can also be a %%function%
# queue is the name of the queue to service the event
# requestReply can be 1 to wait for a reply back from the worker (only 
#   if persistentpool is given for tcp). only request replies if a persistent
#   pool is specified for the transport as well otherwise the app may wait 
#   to receive replies it can never receive. the code uses the reference field to 
#   match responses to requests. to use this functionality either do not specify the
#   reference and the code will generate a random one or use a unique reference
